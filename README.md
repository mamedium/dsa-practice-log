# DSA Practice Log

This repository tracks my progress in learning Data Structures and Algorithms.

I'm using a mix of:
- Udemy DSA course: [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/) by Andrei Neagoie
- roadmap.sh: [Data Structure and Algorithm](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms)
- LeetCode problems
- NeetCode roadmap

## 🧩 Goal
To build a strong foundation in DSA by solving problems daily and tracking patterns and learning.

## 📅 Started: August 4, 2025

## 🛣️ Roadmap
- [x] Arrays & Hashing
- [ ] Two Pointers
- [ ] Sliding Window
- [ ] Stack / Queue
- [ ] Binary Search
